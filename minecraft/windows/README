Compile the cpp files with G++ for windows (into same dir)
make object files ( the vbs script assumes the file names 
are the same as the source names, just with a suffix of .o)

run vbs scripts (or C++ generated executable)

there are 2 example vbs scripts in here (just as an alternative to typing more)
